by Henriques Amaral Guilherme Filipe, Schneider Bastien, Salamin Alexandre


## Description of the project

This project focuses on developing a high-performance vector database, leveraging Qdrant for efficient indexing and retrieval of vector data.

For our project, we decided to do a recommendation of games based on the steam collection until 2019. With Qdrant, it will provide a solution for our project thanks to his rapid and accurate processing.

We will mainly focus on the explanation of how vector database work and compare it to other solution.
